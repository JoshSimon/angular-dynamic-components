<app-tab></app-tab> 


<!-- WORKING ALTERNATIVE - hard coded list without tabs
This works beacuse the "(click)" finds it place neat in the place where the "*ngFor" is iterating through the available mock data
(which is in the case the same as the iterating through the availbale components, see hardcoded in app.component.ts)
-->
<ul class="nav navbar-nav">
  <li *ngFor="let thing of mocks"><a  href="#" (click)="onClick(thing.name)" >{{thing.name}}</a></li>
</ul>
<div myHost> 
      </div>
